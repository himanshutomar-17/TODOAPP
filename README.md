# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
=======
# TODOAPP
Keeping track of tasks is made easier with the Todo App, a simple task management tool. It offers a simple and easy-to-use interface for adding, amending, and removing tasks. React is used for the front end of the program, and Redux is used for state management.
